## Begins with the first step


This is a pathway for anyone who wants to learn how to code. The end goal is to get someone with zero coding knowledge to start building their own complex web applications (or website). The current options for people seeking these goals are either limited to geography, limited to time, or limited to affordability. This project believes that knowledge should be openly accessible and free, and there should be no boundary for knowledge seekers, especially the important knowledge of coding. Coding is a tool to solving problems - and there are many problems out there that needs solving.

The internet hosts a great number of fantastic individual tutorials. However, there is no pathway for beginners to follow. This project serves to organize these information in a manner that is beneficial to beginners.

This project is still in progress, and believes in constant growth. If you believe anything can be made better (be it the pathway, the content, or more resources), or you would like to author more tutorials, just submit a pull request.
