## Begins with the first step

This is a course syllabus of sorts for people who want to learn how to code but are not able to find a sort of pathway to follow. But more specifically, for those who aren't able to find the time or money to go for bootcamps, and other academia type options. That being said, this is no substitute for coding bootcamps!

I've written a post on why I'm doing this. Read it [here](https://medium.com/@tiffaniechia/learning-how-to-code-knowledge-and-direction-f4d79c4dd1b2#.522ihewvc).

Now focusing on the how. I've thought quite hard how to go about this seeing that most of the people who are attempting this would have full-time jobs (and a life!). I built this with some key things about learning how to code in mind. Firstly, programming is a lot about consistency, as with learning any languages, you have to keep at it every day - even if it is just half an hour. It's quite impossible to pick up otherwise (which is why coding bootcamps work really well). Programming is also a lot about solid building blocks - you cannot learn hard concepts if your foundation is shaky - not having a solid foundation will be like trying to speak a foreign language without actually knowing the syntax or weird idiosyncratic language rules.  

Which is why I've broken 'the course' down into bi-weekly learning subjects, starting from the foundation and then working our way up. The first couple of weeks will be very arduous syntax type stuff - stick to it, trust the process. It will feel like hitting a wall, but once you scale the wall the rest will be a smoother climb. The proceeding weeks will be project-based learning, where we will be building actual applications with each focusing on a main learning area. Yes! You'll be building real stuff with the building blocks you've learnt! There is nothing like practice to learn faster :)

Part of learning is receiving good feedback, with that in mind I will be reviewing your code (& get fellow senior techies to help) and nudge you into the right direction. (Caveat: This is currently available to the people I've started sending 'the course' to, I'm figuring out a way to scale this.)

The entire thing will be mostly Javascript focused. Javascript can be used for both front-end and back-end development, making it a very good language to be proficient in. There is also a saying in the world of programming, which is known as the Atwood's Law - any application that can be written a Javascript, will eventually be written in Javascript. So yeah, pretty good skill to have ;)

The main goal is to have any one who attempts this 'course' to be able to build an web application of your wish (hopefully something that will positively impact humanity :)), deploy it to the internet, and have the world use it.

I don't have a set number of weeks you'll take to achieve this because I don't know how much more you might need beyond what I've planned. After all, I really want you guys to have a solid foundation of what you're doing. Plus, this is my first time attempting something like this! I've consulted with a lot of people regarding what the syllabus should look like, and taken some inspiration off the bootcamp I've gone through two years ago. And given I'm some what of a software craftsmanship nazi (All I can say is that I've properly drank/ drowned in the ThoughtWorks kool-aid), I think you're in relatively good hands.

Do reach out if you think there is anything better I can do to help you learn. Let's fail fast :)

*The course currently assumes you're using a Mac, this is a bad assumption. Opening knowledge means not restricting accessibility- I am currently working on a Virtual Machine Tutorial for those on Windows.
*In line with the idea of open knowledge, all the tutorials I will point you at will be free resources.
